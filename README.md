# ai-emerging
I completed several ai based algorithms including neural networks and deep q learning, 
I was given libraries to pull from but ultimately came up with the algorithm for deep q myself using psuedo code while the neural network code was based off of myself. 
Computer scientists innovate non physical infrastructure to allow humans to complete highly complex computations with little effort.
I approach problems as a Computer scientist by engaging a problem headone and figuring out the easiest and most efficint route
My ethical responsibilities include removing bias from machines and enabling software to work for all groups of people
